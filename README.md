#The experimental procedures are owned by Dickinson College - Department of Chemistry (CHEM 347: Concepts of Inorganic Chemistry with Lab)

#All data (UV-Vis and fluorescence) were collected at Dickinson College 

#General procedures: 
1. Synthesis: Precursor solution of Se was prepared in 1-octadecene, which was then combined with reaction solution containing proportionate amounts of CdO, oleic acid and octadecene that was already heated to 225 C. Ater that, Pasteur pipet was used to rapidly remove approximately 1 mL samples at frequent intervals. 9 CdSe quantum dots samples were sucessfually collected.
2. Characterizations: UV-Vis and fluorescence measurements were performed on all samples to estimate quantum dots' radius value. Emitted wavelength for fluorescence is 360 nm.
**Data of the first sample were not included in the analysis for its experimental error.
