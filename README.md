# Synthesis and Characterizations of CdSe Quantum Dots
All data of UV-Vis and fluorescence were collected at Dickinson College 

### I. Background
Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals that are small enough for quantum size effects to become important. The CdSe semiconductor particles synthesized in this project were only a 
few nanometers in diameter, and the fluorescence they display at this size does not occur in the bulk materials. The size of the crystals limits the electronic structure of the 
semiconducting material and changes it in comparison to the bulk. We can use the quantum size effects to consider the nanocrystals as a model system for a particle in a box.
### II. General procedures: 
#### a. Synthesis
Precursor solution of Se was prepared in 1-octadecene, which was then combined with reaction solution containing proportionate amounts of CdO, oleic acid, and octadecene that was just heated to 225 degree Celcius. Ater that, Pasteur pipet was used to rapidly remove approximately 1 mL samples at frequent intervals. 9 CdSe quantum dots samples were sucessfually collected.
#### b. Characterizations
UV-Vis and fluorescence measurements were performed on all samples to estimate quantum dots' radius value. Excited wavelength for fluorescence is 360 nm.

**Data of the first sample were not included in the analysis for its experimental error.
